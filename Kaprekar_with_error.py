Number 6174 is known as Kaprekar’s constant after the Indian mathematician D. R. Kaprekar.
This constant is special because if you take any four-digit number (in which all four digits are NOT identical)
and you follow Kaprekar's procedure, it can be converted into Kaprekar’s constant in at most 8 iterations.

Kaprekar's Procedure:
1. 	Start with a 4-digit number where the 4 digits aren't all be the same (at least 2 digits must be unique).
	Leading 0s are allowed.
2.	Take the 4-digit number and produce 2 new numbers from it by rearranging its digits
	in descending and ascending orders.
3.  Subtract the smaller number (ascending order) from the bigger number (descending order).
4.  Take the difference and check to see if that number is Kaprekar's constant 6174.
	If yes, then you have arrived at the Kaprekar's constant.
	Else, take that number and repeat steps 2-4.
